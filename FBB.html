###Bollinger Band with Fibonacci

<p>We already know that statically it can be proved that the chances of price moving out of bollinger band with Standard deviation setting of 3 is under 3%.</p>

<p>The band can be divided into layers to have dynamic resistance support levels inside the Bollinger Band. Any buy/sell at the resistance and support levels generated by the Fibonacci inside the bollinger should also be get verified with other indicators before a position is taken.</p>

##Explaination to the code
<p>The class "FiboBB" is the indicator class. We will be defining all our code and variables associated with the indicator inside this class. The FiboBB class that we are going to define will do inheritance from another class bt.Indicators i.e. the base class. </p>

<p>Inside the __init__ function of the class moving average and standard deviation has been used.Both of these have also been used from the indicators collection of backtrader. </p>

<p>If you are new to python or are facing difficulties in understanding the indicator code. It is suggested that you read book ["Teach yorself python backtrader"](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09QHWHBGX) from amazon. The book has been written for traders with no prior experience of coding or programming. The author will only touch upon the sections of python programming which are essential for understanding and using backtrader in python.  </p>
